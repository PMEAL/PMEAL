# PMEAL
Porous Materials Engineering and Analysis Lab Website

This repository hosts the homepage of the PMEAL group.  We used to use Wordpress on an Amazon AWS instance, but migrated the site to Github to relieve ourselves of the annoyance of maintaining a web server. It also helps that Github can host sites for free, albeit far less user friendly and featureful than Wordpress.

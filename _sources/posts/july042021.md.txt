# PMEAL Blog and Website now hosted on Github Pages

We used to host all our websites, openpnm.org, porespy.org and pmeal.com, on an Amazon cloud server using Wordpress.  A few months we updated the PoreSpy website/landing page to be the same as the documentation site and moved it to Github instead of "Read The Docs".  Having all the code and docs in the same place was very handy, so we did the same thing to the OpenPNM website.  Now that we are only hosting one website on the Wordpress instance, it makes sense to move PMEAL over to Github as well.  The new site is not quite as fancy looking due limitations of the static build of Github Pages, but seems to looking pretty good so far.  Over the next few weeks we'll be improving things.

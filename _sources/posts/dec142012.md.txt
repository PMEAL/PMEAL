# Prof Gostick presents new image-based invasion algorithm at AGU21

The annual fall meeting of the Americal Geophysical Union (aka AGU) is underway this week.  The PMEAL group gave a talk about our new image-based invasion algorithm that incorporates gravity.  This work was motivated by the ever increasing size of tomograms, which introduces the possibility that gravity may impact the phase distributions.  Standard sphere insertion algorithms only include capillary effects, so this work extended them to also include gravity.  This work is currently under review, so a more detailed announcement and demonstration will be made when it's accepted, but for now you can watch a pre-recorded video of the talk [here](https://tinyurl.com/AGU21-Gostick).

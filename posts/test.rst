Now what? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Tell them I hate them. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! You mean while I'm sleeping in it? __Ummmâ€¦to eBay?__ *No!* The cat shelter's on to me.

# Congratulations to Niloo for successfully defending her PhD!

Niloofar Misaghian joined the PMEAL group in the fall of 2018, and after 4 years of intense learning and research she successfully defended her thesis on December 9th.  It was a slam-dunk, with 3 first-author papers, plus authorship on another.  Not to mention many contributions to the OpenPNM and PoreSpy code bases.  Thanks for all your hard work Niloo!

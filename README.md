# PMEAL Website

Porous Materials Engineering and Analysis Lab Website

This repository hosts the homepage of the PMEAL group.  We used to use Wordpress on an Amazon AWS instance, but migrated the site to Github to relieve ourselves of the annoyance of maintaining a web server.

This site is created using [quarto](https://quarto.org). It's quite a powerful and handy tool and probably worth writing a blog post about someday.

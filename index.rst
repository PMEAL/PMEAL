PMEAL Homepage
##############

The Porous Materials Engineering & Analysis Lab (PMEAL) focuses on the study of atypical porous media, such as engineered materials including electrodes, membranes, filters, papers, and catalyst supports.  These materials are a challenge to study using the classic tools and theories developed for the traditional geoscience applications such as rock, sand, and soil.

Research in our lab focuses on three main aspects: measuring transport and structural properties by developing novel characterization tools, modeling transport processes and device performance using pore-scale simulations, and making customized materials targeted for specific applications based on the findings and results of the other two steps.  We are also highly interested in visualization of porous materials using x-ray tomography, and extracting previously unimaginable information via quantitative analysis on the resultant volumetric images.  This aspect of our work actually bridges all three of the main themes.

PMEAL is run by `Prof. Jeff Gostick <https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/profile/jgostick>`_ and is located at the `University of Waterloo <https://uwaterloo.ca>`_, in the `Department of Chemical Engineering <https://uwaterloo.ca/chemical-engineering/>`_.  For more information on the type of projects being pursued by the PMEAL team, take a look at the `Publications page <http://www.pmeal.com/publications/>`_, or check out Prof. Gostick's `Google Scholar page <https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=ikQG1IkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en>`_.


Bio
###
Professor Jeff Gostick is an Associate Professor in Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where he runs the Porous Materials Engineering & Analysis Lab.  Prior to joining UofW he was an Associate Professor in Chemical Engineering at McGill University in Montreal from 2010 to 2016.  His PhD work focused on multiphase transport phenomena in hydrogen fuel cells. Upon completion of his PhD from the University of Waterloo in 2008 he did post-doctoral work at with the US Department of Energy at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, where he used the ALS synchrotron to perform 'cat scans' on electrodes, which led to his current interest in volumetric image analysis. He is the lead developer of the open-source pore network modeling projects OpenPNM (openpnm.org) and PoreSpy (porespy.org), both of which focus on understanding transport pheneomena at the pore-scale. Prof Gostick was recently named an Emerging Leader by the Canadian Society of Chemical Engineering.
